   <h2>Forget not that the earth delights to feel your bare feet and the winds long to play with your hair.</h2>

   <h3>Look deep into nature, and then you will understand everything better.</h3>
   
   <h4>Heaven is under our feet as well as over our heads.</h4>

   <h5> In nature, nothing is perfect and everything is perfect. 
    Trees can be contorted, bent in weird ways, and they're still beautiful.</h5>
