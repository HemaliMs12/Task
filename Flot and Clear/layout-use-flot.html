        <h1>“Collect Moments, Not Things.”</h1>
  
        <p>“We live in a wonderful world that is full of beauty, 
            charm and adventure. There is no end to the adventures 
            we can have if only we seek them with our eyes open.”</p>
  
        <blockquote>
          <p>“The use of traveling is to regulate imagination by reality, 
            and instead of thinking how things may be, to see them as they are.”</p>
        </blockquote>
    
        <p>“Perhaps travel cannot prevent bigotry, but by demonstrating that all peoples cry, laugh, eat, worry, and die, 
            it can introduce the idea that if we try and understand each other, we may even become friends.”</p>
